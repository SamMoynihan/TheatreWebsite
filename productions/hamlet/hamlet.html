  <h2><b>About the play</b></h2>

  <p>The play opens with Prince Hamlet, depressed, returning to Denmark from Germany to attend his father's funeral. He is shocked to learn that his mother Gertrude has already remarried, his father's brother Claudius who has crowned himself king
    despite Hamlet being heir to the throne. The ghost of Hamlet's father visits Elsinore castle, unable to rest in peace and tells Hamlet that he was killed by Claudius and asks him to avenge his fate, sparing the life of Gertrude.
    The news alters Hamlet's mental state and he draws together a test to see if this news is true. After he observes his uncle watching a play and reacting to scenes of murder he becomes convinced that the treachery is true and commits himself to
    righting the wrong.
