<p>Size isn't everything - but it helps. Wicked duly arrives in the West End from Broadway on a wave of audience if not unanimous critical approval, where it is the top-grossing show on the Great White Way.

A musical about the casting of spells seems to have cast its own, hypnotising audiences who have embraced it not so much as a musical as an event.</p>
</br>

<p>It could very well be critic-proof here, if the audience reaction at the Apollo Victoria are anything to go by, too. For this is a show that seems to tap into a genuine public appetite for spectacle, art and heart, and this demanding, sometimes commanding musical provides it in spades.

But is there a human scale to such a superhuman-sized show?</p>
</br>

<p>Fortunately, that's provided by the vibrant pairing of Hannah Corneau, recreating her Tony Award-winning turn as Elphaba, brassily paired with the attractive musical newcomer Ginna Mason as Glinda, the two leads of this musical deconstruction of the "untold story of the Witches of Oz."</p>
</br>

<p>Just as Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Into the Woods famously offered an unravelling of popular fairytales sent into collision with each other, so Wicked unpacks the Wizard of Oz back-story, long before Dorothy found she wasn't in Kansas anymore.</p>
