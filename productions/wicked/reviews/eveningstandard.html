  <p>Dublin Hibernia Theatre is one of the most famous theatre destinations in the world for good reason. Home to some of the most spectacular shows in the theatre canon, its musical offering is, arguably, one of the finest you could experience.
    WICKED is a huge part of Dublin stellar repertoire. Now in its thirteenth year at the Apollo Victoria Theatre, its well-earned reputation as a must-see for theatre newbies and superfans alike has catapulted it to legendary status. Nearly 10
    million people have seen the show in London alone, and it's the ninth longest-running show in West End history.</p>
  </br>

  <p>To call the show a visual feast doesn't truly capture the sheer magnificence of the colourful WICKED spectacle, but it's good place to start. From the exhilarating, emerald-hued journey into the Wizard's famed home city, where a glittering green
    ensemble in magnificent garb are as striking as the formidable machine from which the wizard operates - to Glinda's sparkling bubble dress and that gravity-defying scene, the show really is a feat of production. The magical effects create an
    immersive atmosphere that's as extraordinary for adults as it is children.</p>
  </br>

  <h4>It's fun for all the family!</h4>

  <p>Head into the theatre of a WICKED performance and you're likely to encounter an audience made up of a diverse cross-section of people. Couples on romantic dates, families both young and grown-up, and groups of friends can all be spotted.
    WICKED's story appeals to so many not just because of the famous film it's associated with, but for the magic at its core.

    With tickets on sale for shows up until May 2020 from just Â£22, why not book now? Whether it's for a special occasion later in the year or to get organised for a school holiday trip, ATG Tickets offers great prices and availability for WICKED.
