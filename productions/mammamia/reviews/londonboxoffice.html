<h2><b>London Box Office</b></h2>


<p>The show features Abba songs which are cleverly integrated into the story written by Catherine Johnson. Young Sophie who lives with her mother on a small Greek island is about to be married to Sky and wishes for her father to walk her down the aisle. However, she has a problem, who is her father? Her mother does not want to tell her and so Sophie reads her mother’s diary and discovers the name of three men who could possibly be her dad. Sophie secretly invites all three men to the wedding. The fun starts when the three men arrive on the island and discover why they have been invited.The show bounds along with endless energy and enthusiasm. The mixture of Abba songs, camp dance routines, platform boots and Lycra costumes based around a soppy romance comedy script creates a delightful evening of sheer fun and pleasure. This is pop music set to pop culture, pure unapologetic seventies tackiness that makes for a great evening’s entertainment.</p>
</br>
<p>Mamma Mia! is energetic, funny and entertaining and appeals to all ages. No doubt one of the reasons the show is a success is because it does not try to be anything other than popular entertainment,and the production has the confidence to recognise this fact and does not take itself too seriously. For example, songs, such as “Chiquitita”, “Take A Chance On Me”, “Does Your Mother Know” are ingeniously slipped into the story line, and the audience bursts into favourable applause each time it happens. Kirstie Hoiles who plays Donna is the indubitable star of the show, her powerful singing voice is superb for the Abba songs that she belts out. Her co-stars Sophie Matthew and Taylor Bradford, who play Donna’s old friends Rosie & Tanya, both give great comic performances, as well as having strong singing voices. These three women create a great comic trio and completely dominate the show. Choreographer Anthony van Laast’s dance arrangement for Sophie’s dream sequence is both daring and ridiculous and as a result is an hilarious success.</p>

<p>So has the show received a critical panning from the popular press as was expected? Well, the notices have not been that bad. NICHOLAS DE JONGH of the EVENING STANDARD says, "Thank you for the music…shame about the musical". BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE of THE TIMES says, " With so much fun in the theatrical air, the rest of us might as well indulge them." SHERIDEN MORLEY on TELETEXT really enjoyed the show saying, "After a shaky start, Mamma Mia soars" and goes on to say, "It's a genuinely touching and comic book allied to some of the greatest and most theatrical pop songs ever written." KATE BASSETT of THE DAILY TELEGRAPH says, "Unfortunately, Johnson's dialogue often sounds like a banal soap opera" and goes onto say, "The cast are clearly having a hoot, almost raising their eyebrows when they have to break into lyrics that are barely relevant." THE FINANCIAL TIMES says, "You shouldn't take Mamma Mia! seriously: which is precisely why it proves to be one of the few good musicals on the London stage today."This show is strictly for people who like ABBA songs and like to have a 'good time'. Don't go to the show expecting any gripping story line, just go with the mind of enjoying the songs, reminiscing and having a lot of fun.This musical is a must for all ABBA fans!!</p>
