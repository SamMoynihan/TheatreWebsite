Our showcases have included world class opera, musicals, drama, revues, comedy, concerts, dance, festivals and pantomime.
Throughout the last century our performances have brought laughter and tears, shock and delight, as well as thoughtful cultural commentary to our audiences.
Our vision has remained unchanged in providing a space for art, culture and life to collide.
